These are my notes! I am making them so that I can demonstate git use.


piece moves.

need to know where your pieces are and where other pieces are. \
reusable functionality? what can be reused \
front, back, diagonal, etc. \
don't make a subclass for each piece \
piece move calculator in a separate class, parent class \
then subclass for each piece \
